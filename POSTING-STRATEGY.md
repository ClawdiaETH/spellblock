## $CLAWDIA Integration Messaging

### Positioning
SpellBlock = **the game** for $CLAWDIA. Not "a" utility — "THE" utility.

### Natural Integration Points

1. **Win announcements:** "Player won X $CLAWDIA!" (not just "won")
2. **Pot size updates:** Always in $CLAWDIA terms
3. **Burn updates:** "X $CLAWDIA burned this round 🔥"
4. **Stakes discussion:** "What's your strategy for staking?"

### Avoid
- ❌ "Buy $CLAWDIA to play" (sounds shilly)
- ❌ "Price pump" language
- ❌ Detaching game from token

### Do
- ✅ "Stake $CLAWDIA" (natural in-game action)
- ✅ "Win $CLAWDIA" (reward framing)
- ✅ "Every round burns $CLAWDIA" (utility narrative)
- ✅ "$CLAWDIA holders earn from every round" (passive benefit)
